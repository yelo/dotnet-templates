# dotnet-templates
This is just a collection of my dotnet templates for .net 5

## Console Application with Dependency Injection
You can install this template and generate new projects if you want to skip the boilerplate code for DI/logging/configuration in console applications.

To install it, run the following command:
- `dotnet new --install Yelo.Templates.Console.DependencyInjection::*`

To generate a new project, run the following command:
- `dotnet new console-di`
